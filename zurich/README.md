# zurich-trip

Post Trip analysis
---
Didnt wear shorts at all
other cities were 6/7 hours travel by train -> check travel times next time
    - so I did not get to visit any others
Instead look at local hikes more in depth and prepare
    - snow made it difficult when it was calf deep alone
    - should have brought the garmin in reach, considering I did the hikes alone need the security

Arosa was a great town
Chur was fine

the best part was seeing family. 
John worries me

When traveling check which way you gain/lose days overseas
this was convinient flying back, Going to work Wednesday was super easy 
1. because I had no chores
2. because I slept great from the 'long' day I just had flying back




Dec 4 - Dec 9 (2 travel days 4 days there)
